# Home Automation System using Arduino
Home Automation System using Arduino UNO R3 on TinkerCad

# OBJECTIVE:

The main objective of this project is to design and develop a prototype of a home automation controllable through different sensors embedded in the home infrastructure.  Perceive and act plays their roles here in the process of Task Automation at home and to have various types of operation in order to obtain the purpose for which this technology was invented: maximizing user’s comfort offering an easy way to personalize home.

# ABSTRACT:

Comfort is a new trend as technology is advancing, so houses are also getting smarter. Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to centralized control system, involving remote controlled switches. Presently, conventional wall switches located in different parts of the house makes it difficult for the user to go near them to operate. Even more it becomes more difficult for the elderly or physically handicapped people to do so. Utilising different sensors such as the PIR sensor and Ultrasonic Distance Sensor the things could have been possible in order to make the things according to our comfort. Arduino Uno board and its integrated applications are the major help in making the things possible.
                         

# INTRODUCTION:

Smart home is defined as a home that has programmable electronic controls and sensors that regulate heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, and appliance and equipment operation in a  way that responds to  interior climate conditions in  order to conserve energy. Utilising different sensors such as the PIR sensor and Ultrasonic Distance Sensor the things could have been possible in order to make the things according to our comfort. Arduino Uno board and its integrated applications as well are the major help in making the things possible.
Smart homes use home automation technologies to provide homeowners with intelligent 
feedback and information by monitoring many aspects of a home on daily basis.
Main elements of smart home
1.  Internal network - wire, cable, wireless. 
2.  Intelligent control - gateway to manage the systems. 
3.  Home automation - products within the homes and links to services and systems 
outside the home.

# CONCEPTS/WORKING PRINCIPLE

The three major parts of the Task Automation at Home are 1. PIR sensor 2. Ultrasonic Sensor 3. LDR 
1.	PIR sensor
Motion detection use light sensors to detect either the presence of infrared light emitted from a warm object or absence of infrared light when a object interrupts a beam emitted by another part of the device.
A PIR sensor detects the infrared light radiated by a warm object. It consists of pyro electric sensors which introduce changes in their temperature (due to incident infrared radiation) into electric signal. When infrared light strikes a crystal, it generates an electrical charge.
Thus a PIR sensor can be used to detect presence of human beings within a detection area of approximately 14 meters.
2.	Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting sound waves at a frequency too high for humans to hear. They then wait for the sound to be reflected back, calculating distance based on the time required. This is similar to how radar measures the time it takes a radio wave to return after hitting an object
3.	LDR 
A photoresistor (or light-dependent resistor, LDR,or photo-conductive cell) is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity.a photoresistor is made of a high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megohms (MΩ), while in the light,a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms
